My name is __Precious Adewunmi__, I am a first year Computer Science and Mathematics student at the University of York


My passion are 
- Nigerian Cusine
- Numbers and Data (*typical of a mathematics student*)
- Inspiring females and A-level retake students to pursue STEM based subjects or career paths. 

I am inquistive about **Data security**, such as what are cookies, how big technology firm process our data and how do thrid party companies benefit from this. 

My education journey hasn't been conventional, but the mentorship and support I have recieved has helped me, preserve and be resillence. I hope to helo other like myself who to be resilent, if I can do one thing it would be to help others.
