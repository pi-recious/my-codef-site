# My Educational Journey (Blog Post)
![SecondarySchool](SecondarySchool.jpg)
I did quite well in my GCSE, I got an A in year in GCSE Mathematics in Year 9 and got a B in English Langauge, even though I got a U in my Decemeber Mock and I was in the bottom set for 3 years. One lesson to take from my secondary moment is __to not let teachers define your ability__, exams and class should not be your only reflection of your talent.

<h3>Then came the dreadful Alevels</h3>
