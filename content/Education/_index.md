# My Educational Journey (Blog Post)
![SecondarySchool](SecondarySchool.jpg)
I did quite well in my GCSE, I got an A in GCSE Mathematics in Year 9 and got a B in English Langauge, even though I got a U in my Decemeber Mock and I was in the bottom set for 3 years. One lesson to take from secondary is __to not let teachers define your ability__, exams and classes should not be your only reflection of your talent.

<h3>Then came the dreadful Alevels</h3>

My greatest achievement to date?

Receiving my university unconditional offer. In the previous year, I was rejected by my firm and insurance offer as I didn’t make the grade. I did not allow this experience to hinder my success instead, I took the used the next to independently teach myself my Alevels and to improve skills such as my time management, anxiety and learning strategy. This was the first time where I had to be independent, I created a new timetable, although the first timetable was unrealistic and hard to stick to, I remained persistent and kept improving the timetable until it was effective. All the self-reflection and new skills I had developed ultimately helped me to improve my grades by 2 or more and resulted in me receiving multiple university offer. Furthermore enabling me to explore a career that by paper I would not have been good enough.
